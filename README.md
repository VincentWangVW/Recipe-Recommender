## Summary

Have you ever opened your pantry and was unsure on what to cook with the things inside? Maybe there is some ingredients you've stored in there for so so long you just don't know how to use. This is why we made Recipe Recommender, an app in which you can input ingredients and their amounts that will take that and generate recipes from it. The app can also store how many items you're willing to buy if you have all items except a few as well as any allergies you may have such as peanuts, dairy, or anything custom and it will try its best to filter recipes with those items out! The app can also generate recipes based off any holidays, if there are any, or the season of the current date. This makes it so that if you're wanting to cook something in a festive mood, you can always use our app! Lastly, there is a custom recipe search which searches recipes based off any word you want! If you're in the mood for burgers, you can search burgers and find some burger related recipes! After generating the recipes, there a menu that shows you how many items you're missing, the name for the recipe, and the recipe URL in which you can open with your browser of choice to view the recipe! <br/>

We made this program because we were all struggling with cooking and many of us had relied on DoorDash for any "non-ramen" meals, we also were unsure of how to cook and wanted some different recipes we could try throughout the year. With that idea, we came up with recipe recommender which helped us empty our pantries of stuff we never really used as well as helping us become better cooks!
